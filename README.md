# Key Components
- IAM User Setup: Creation of an `IAM user` with necessary permissions for AWS deployment and management.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Utilization of `Terraform` and `AWS CLI`for setting up the Jumphost server `(EC2 instance)` on AWS..Used yet another Github workflow to automate it!(https://github.com/jignyasamishra/iac_code)
- GitHub Actions Configuration: Configuration of essential `GitHub Actions` workflows, including `Snyk`, `Docker`, `Sonarqube`, `Terraform`, `Kubectl`, `AWS CLI`, and `Trivy`.
- EKS Cluster Deployment: Deployment of an `Amazon EKS` cluster using `eksctl` commands.
- Load Balancer Configuration: Configuration of `AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)` for the EKS cluster.
- Dockerhub Repositories: Automatic creation of repositories for frontend and backend Docker images on Dockerhub.
- ArgoCD Installation: Setup of `ArgoCD` for continuous delivery and GitOps.
- Sonarqube Integration: Integration of `Sonarqube` for `code quality` analysis
- Snyk Integration: Integration of `Snyk` for `vulnerability scanning` and `dependency management` analysis
- Trivy Integration: Integration of `Trivy` for `container image` and filesystem `vulnerability scanning`
- GitHub Action Pipelines: Creation of `GitHub Action` pipelines for deploying backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster.
- Monitoring Setup: Implementation of monitoring for the EKS cluster using `Helm`, `Prometheus`, and `Grafana`.
- ArgoCD Application Deployment: Deployment of the Three-Tier application, including database, backend, frontend, and ingress components, using ArgoCD.
- DNS Configuration: Configuration of DNS settings for application accessibility via custom subdomains.
- Data Persistence: Implementation of persistent volume and persistent volume claims for database pods to ensure data persistence.
